-- The vehicle with VIN KNDPB3A20D7558809 is about to be returned. Carnival has a pretty cool program where it offers the returned vehicle to 
-- the most recently hired employee at 70% of the cost it previously sold for. The most recent employee accepts this offer and will purchase the vehicle 
-- once it is returned. The employee and dealership who sold the car originally will be on the new sales transaction.
